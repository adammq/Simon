# Simon
Barebones Simon (game) on a Raspbery Pi Zero W

Note: the seemingly random LED sequences (the ones using the modular arithmetic) are implemented as visual feedback to alert the player of two things: (1) the game is beginning, (2) you have leveled up.

Perhaps the code could be cleaner, but this was a once through "let's see if we can get this to work" type deal. Any suggested improvements are welcome!
